### Real-Time Task Manager Application

The Real-Time Task Manager Application is a web-based task management system built using Python Flask for backend and HTML, CSS & Bootstrap for the frontend.  For database I have used the SQLite with the integration of SQLAlchemy. This README provides an overivew of the application and instruction to run application and installing its dependencies.
